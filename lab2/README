      The HTML <a> (anchor) tag defines a hyperlink.
      A hyperlink (or link) is a word, group of words, or image that you can  click on to jump to another document.
      When you move the cursor over a link in a Web page, the arrow will turn into a little hand.
      The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link’s destination.
      By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

            1. An unvisited link is underlined and blue.
            2. A visited link is underlined and purple.
            3. An active link is underlined and red.
